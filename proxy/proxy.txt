-Motivation
-Standard Library Smart Pointers
-Virtual Proxy
-Communication Proxy
-Proxy vs Decorator

-You are calling foo.bar()
-This assumes that foo resides in the same process as bar.
-What if, later on, you want to put all Foo related operations into a separate process?
      -How can you avoid changing all your code?

Proxy to the rescue!
      -same interface, different behavior.

This is a communication proxy
     -Others:logging, virtual, guarding...

Proxy
A class that is functioning as an interface to a particular resource. That resource may be remote, expensive to construct, or may require logging or some other added functionality.
