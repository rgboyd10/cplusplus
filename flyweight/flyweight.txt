Flyweight
----

Motivation
-Avoid redundancy when storing data
-E.g., MMORPG
       -Plenty of users with identical first/last names
       -No sense in storing same first/last name over and over again
       -Store a list of names and pointers to them

E.g., bold or italic text in the console
      -don't want each character to have an extra formatting character
      -Operate on ranges (e.g., line, start/end)

Flyweight - A space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing externally the data associated with similar objects.

----

Store common data externally or use a Flyweight library type.

Define the idea of 'ranges' on homogeneous collections and store data related to those ranges.
