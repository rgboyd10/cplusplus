RAII - Resource Acquisition is Initialization

try
{
	auto x = new X(Stuff);
	//risky stuff
	delete x;
}
catch(exection& e)
{
	//react
}

vs

try
{
	auto x = make_shared<X>(Stuff);
	     //risky stuff
}
catch(exception& e)
{
	//react
}

-There is no finally keyword or a need for one

allocate local stack objects correctly
