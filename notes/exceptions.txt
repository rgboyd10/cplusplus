Exceptions

-Transfer flow of execution from the problem location to somewhere that can handle it.
	  -Skips intervening code.

-Developer can't forget to check return value.
	   -The function doesn't return.

-Continue to deal with things as close to the problem as possible.

-you need to know about stack unwinding.

TRY/CATCH
-Wrap that might throw an exception in a try block.
-Try/catch as close to the problem as possible.
-Catch more specific exceptions first.
-Catch exceptions by reference.
       -Great for catching a dervied exception

       try
       {
	//risky stuff
       }
       catch(out_of_range& oor)
       {
	//react
       }
       catch(exception& e)
       {
	//react
       }
       
WHAT TO THROW AND CATCH
-C++ allows you to throw and catch anything
     -int, string, instance of a class

-Puts quite a burden on the developer.
      -If it exists
      -If it mentions the exception

-The Standard Library includes and exception class
     -Base class to a hierarchy of exceptions.
     -Uses classes dervied from it when it needs to throw.

std::exception
-has a member function: string what()
-has a number of dervied clases
     -logic_error:
	-domain_error
	-invalid_argument
	-length_error
	-out_of_range

     -runtime_error
	-overflow_error
	-range_error
	-underflow_error

These are called "marker classes"

UNWINDING THE STACK
-When an excpetion is thrown
-If in a try, everything local to try goes out of scope
    -destructors go off
    -control goes to the catch

-If not, everything local to the function goes out of scope
    -control returns to where that cuntion was called from
    -recurse to an "if ina try" above

-If you get all the way out of main(), the user gets a dialog
    -But it's more interesting when you up in a catch

Exceptions have a cost
	   -Little or nor cost to set up a try/catch if the exception is not thrown.
	   -If it's thrown, time is used up (much more than if)
	   -Don't use for data entry validation(eg Feb 30th)
	   	  -Test with if, show user error messae
           -More useful with deep calling hierarchy
	   	 -A calls b calls c calls d calls e
		 - Each must test return value, prevent further calculations if something went wrong
		 -That can take time too
		 -Using exceptions make neater code that runs faster when everything goes well
		 -Best for rare occurrences like disk full, network feel down etc
