SOLID Design Principles

-Single Responsibility Principle(SRP)
	-A class should only have a single responsibility

-Open-Closed Principle(OCP)
	     -Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

-Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
	-Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering program correctness.

-Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
	   -Many client-specific interfaces better than one general-purpose interface.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
	   -Dependencies should be abstract rather than concrete.
