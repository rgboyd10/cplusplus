Builder
-When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly.

Examples
-Building a string out of substrings
	  -E.g., a web server page rendering
-Concatenate a single std::string
	     -my_text += boost::lexical_cast<string>(my_int);

-printf(%s = %n", "meaning of life", 42);

-Boost.Format
	-format("%1%, x=%2% : %3%-th try") % "toto" % 40.23 % 50

-Represent as OO structure and implement operator << on an object graph.
