Useful Operations
----

Remember partial_sort_copy?

----

Swapping

swap()

iter_swap()

swap_ranges() - works within or between collections

---

Reordering Elements by Hand

Rotate

----

Advantages of Algorithms
-Quicker to write
-Quick for everyone else to read for the rest of time
-Probably faster
-Better tested

----

Partition
----

Summary
-Some <algorithm> functins have odd names
      -What they do, not what they're for

Think of
      -partial_sort_copy as top_n
      -rotate as move_within)collection
      -stable_partition as gather

Knowing they exist makes the difference
