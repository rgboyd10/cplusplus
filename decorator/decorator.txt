Decorator
-Motivation
-Function Decorator
-Wrappiung Decorator
-Mixin Inheritance
-Usability Improvements
----

Motivation
-Want to augment existing functionality.
-Do not want to rewrite or alter existing code (Open-Closed Principle)
-Want to keep new functionality separate (Single Responsibility Principle)
-Need to be able to interact with existing structures.

---

Decorator
-Allows for adding behavior to individual objects without affecting the behavior of other objects of the same class.
---

Summary
-Functional decorators let you wrap functions with before/after code (for, eg., logging)
-An aggregate decorator does not give you the underlying object's features, but can be composed at runtime
-A decorator based on mixing inheritance is more flexible, exposes underlying object's but is only constructible at compile time.
