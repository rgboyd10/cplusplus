Composite
-Motivation
-Object Composition
-Geometric Shapes
-Neural Networks

Motivation
-Objects can use other object's fields and function through inheritance and composition.
-Composition lets us make compound objects.
	     -A mathematical expression composed of simpler expressions.
	     -A grouping of shapes that make up several shapes

Composite design pattern is used to treat both single and composite objects uniformly (e.g., with idential APIs.

----
Composite
-A mechanism for treating individual(scalar) and compositions of objects in a uniform manner.
-----

Summary
-Objects can use either objects either via inheritance or composition.
-Some composed and singular objects need similar/identical behaviors/
-Composite design pattern lets us treat both type of objects uniformly.
-C++ has no special support for the idea of enumeration of objects.
-A single objects can masquerade to become suitable for begin/end iteration.
