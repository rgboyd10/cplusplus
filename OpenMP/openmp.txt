Imperative and Declarative Parallelism

Imperative - when you do everything by hand. You separate the data set into several independent parts. You create threads for each of the parts(std::threads, pthreads, etc.) You would run the computation on each thread. You deal with issues related to data sharing across threads. You might use libraries such as Microsoft PPL, Intel TBB, etc.)

Declarative approach - you leave existing sequential code as-is but you decorate the code with compiler hints such as 'parallelize this'. The compiler splits your code(ex - a for loop) into several threads.
