Lambda

-an expression that represents doing something
-imagine handing an operation or function(code) to some other operation or function
	 -for generic work
	 -for a functional style
	 -for concurrency
	 -for readability
	      -eliminates tiny functions

Tiny Functions
void print(int i)
{
	cout << i << " ";
}

int main()
{
	vector <int> v;
	//...
	for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), print);
}

use a lambda istead

int main()
{
	vector <int> v;
	//...
	for_each(v.begin(), v.end(),
	[](int i) //beginning of the lambda
	       {
		cout << i << " ";
	       }
		);
}
--------------------------
RETURNING
-Lambdas may return a value
-Only a return statement in the lambda
      -Return type inferred by compiler

-More than one statement
      -Development must specify return type

[](int n) -> double {/**/}
-------------------------

When you write a lambda, the compiler generates an anonymous function object
     -Overrides(operator - the function call
     -Parameters are in the () of the lambda
     -Return type is after the -> of the lambda

Has member variables that hold values the lambda might use
    -controlled by info in the [] of the lambda


You can keep this functin object in a variable or just use it right away as we've been doing.

-------------------
The capture
-empty [] - captures nothing, works only with function parameters
-[x,y] - capture x and y by value
       -copies are made
       -lambda can be use when x and y have gone out of scope

-[&x,&y] - capture x and y by reference
	 -no copies, changes affect the original
	 -dangling references may be an issue

-[=]-copy "everything" by value
	  -actually it's everything use in the body of the lambda

-[&]-copy "everything" by reference.

'Mutable' keyword - don't make the member variables const
