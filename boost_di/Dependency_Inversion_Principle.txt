Dependency Inversion Principle
-Summary
	1.High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
	Example : reporting component should depend on a ConsoleLogger, but can depend on an ILogger.

	2.Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
	In other words, dependencies on interfaces and supertypes is better than dependencies on concrete types.

-Inversion of Control (IoC) - the acutal process of creating abstractions and getting them to replace dependencies.
-Dependency Injection - use of software frameworks to ensure that a component's dependencies are satisfied.
