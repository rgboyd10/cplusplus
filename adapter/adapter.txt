-Motivation
-Stack as an Adapter
-Simple String Adapter
-Vector/Raster Demo
-Adapter Caching
----
Eletrical devices have differen power interface requirements
	  -Voltage(5V, 220V)
	  -Socket/plug type(Europe, UK, USA)

We cannot modify our gadgets to support every possible interface.
   -Some support possible (120/220V)

Thus we use a device(an adapter) that gives us the interface we require.

Adapter - a construct which adapts an existing interface X to confirm to the required interface Y.

----
Implementing is easy.
Determing the API you have and the API you need.
Create a component which aggregates(has a reference to,..) the adaptee.
Intermediate representations can pile up; use caching and other optimizations.
