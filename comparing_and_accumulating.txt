Comparing and Accumulating
-std::pair - can hold any combination of types.
-strongly typed
-get the elements with .first and .second

Total the Elements of a Collection
-accumulate()
	-uses the operator +

-or use a lambda - total does not have to be the same type as elements

A Loop in Disguise
-for_each()
-takes a lambda
-touches each element once
-does not have to apply to the entire collection

Summary
-Comparing two collections is easy
-The pair class is very useful
     -not just when comparing
-Adding up or combining all the elements of a collection is just one line of code
-If you're sure you need a loop, consider for_each instead
