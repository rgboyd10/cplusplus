CONST WITH POINTERS
- You can declare the pointer to be const
  int * const cpI
  -Then you can't change it to point somewhere else.

- Or that it points at something const
 const int* cpI
 -Then you can't use it to change the value of the target.

- Or both if you really want
  const int * const crazy
