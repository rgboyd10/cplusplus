Overview
-Motivation
-Point Initialization Example
-Factory Method
-Factory External Class
-Factory Inner Class
-Abstract Factory

Motivation
-Object creation logic becomes too convoluted
-Constructor is not descriptive because
	     -Name mandated by name of containing type
	     -Cannot overload with same set of arguments with different names
	     -Can turn into 'optional parameter hell'

-Object creation(non-piecewise, unlike Builder) can be outsource to
	-A separate function(Factory Method)
	-That may exist in a separate class(Factory)
	-You can even have a hierarchy of class with Abstract Factory

Factory
-A separate component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.

Abstract Factory
-A factory construct used to construct objects in hierarchies.

Factory Method
-A function that helps create objects.Like a constructor but more descriptive.

Module Overview
-A factory method is a function that creates objects.
-A factor can take care of object creation.
-A factory can reside inside object or be external.
-Hierarchies of factories can be used to create related objects.
